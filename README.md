# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Tricky
### About Me
I'm a passionate and dedicated **Senior Software Engineer** with a background in **robotics engineering**. My journey in technology has taken me through a variety of challenging roles, each building on the last and setting the foundation for my current work.

I began my career answering phones for a service desk but was quickly promoted through the support team as my technical aptitude and willingness to learn shone through. I automated much of my job, always searching out new responsibilities. I worked on network infrastructure, server installations, and even had the opportunity to work on penetration testing projectsâ€”writing exploits, escalating permissions, and bypassing physical security measures. I found I had a particular talent for the physical aspects of security, including social engineering and gaining access to restricted areas.

Out of all the experiences I had, **Software Engineering** and **Penetration Testing** were my favorites. However, with a young family, I chose the work-life balance that Software Engineering offered, allowing me to focus my career in that direction. Along the way, I was fortunate enough to land roles that also let me indulge my passion for hardware design, which has become a rewarding hobby.

I have worked on a diverse range of exciting projects, such as building systems to prevent Road-Rail Vehicles from colliding with moving trains by calculating kinetic envelopes and setting slew and height limiters. I also worked on track inspection devices, both rail-mounted and drone-based, as well as crane systems for moving shipping containers and molten metal in steelworks. Currently, at a WMS software company, I was part of a small team that designed and built a robotic cart, and I now lead the engineering of their multi-agent warehouse orchestration platform. This system allows seamless integration of the WMS with various robotic and automated systems. Alongside this, I am working on an **Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV)** project.

### Core Values & Approach
I'm a strong believer in continuous improvement, both for myself and the systems I work on. I bring a thoughtful, inquisitive nature to my work and enjoy collaborating with teams to solve interesting problems. I approach software design from a user-centric perspective, ensuring solutions are not only powerful but also intuitive.

### Interests Outside Work
When I'm not coding, I love to spend time with my wonderful family, exploring the outdoors, and diving into various creative projects. I'm a lifelong learner and always on the lookout for new topics to dig into.
